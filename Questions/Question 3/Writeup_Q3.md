# Question 3

**A TI Sitara–class** is the option I’d pick for this EtherCAT master + real-time clamp controller, mainly because it hits the “industrial timing first” sweet spot: deterministic I/O (very peripheral-friendly) + enough compute for our 1 kHz control law, without the scheduling/jitter headaches we fight on a big Linux/GPU module and without the resource constraints of a small MCU when we add EtherCAT master duties, safety interlocks, logging, and diagnostics.

If I had to justify my choice using all the data I have from the datasheet I would say: EtherCAT success is less about peak GHz and more about bounded latency + predictable scheduling. Our control loop is 1 ms nominal, and what breaks real systems is not average cycle time but the tails (rare 2-5 ms slips) that cause bad contact detection, late torque backoff, and mode-switch confirmation weirdness. Sitara-style industrial SoCs are built for this exact problem: “do Ethernet/EtherCAT + deterministic real-time tasks + basic Linux services” reliably. More specifically, For this EtherCAT controlled vise system running a 1 kHz 1 millisecond supervisory control loop I would select a TI AM625 Sitara class SoC because it provides the right balance of deterministic timing and compute margin without unnecessary overhead. The mechanical control bandwidth is only about 15 to 25 Hz so a 1 kHz loop gives more than 40 times oversampling while keeping phase lag and jitter manageable. The AM625 multi core Cortex A53 architecture allows clean isolation of the real time control thread using real time scheduling and core pinning from the EtherCAT master and logging tasks which reduces worst case latency compared to a GPU heavy Linux system on module. Unlike a 120 MHz microcontroller where EtherCAT master control and diagnostics can push CPU utilization toward CPU utilization equals 

    (C_control + C_EtherCAT + C_logging / T_cycle) 
    
approaching one the AM625 provides ample headroom while maintaining predictable scheduling. Its industrial Ethernet subsystem DMA support hardware timers and real time Linux capability make it well suited for bounded 1 millisecond cyclic communication while the servo drive continues closing the high rate inner torque loop internally. This results in a robust scalable production ready architecture optimized for determinism rather than raw clock speed.
